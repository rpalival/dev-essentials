## HTML

1. 99% of the time **use classes** instead of IDs coz there can only be 1 unique ID value
2. Always use **`<a>`** tag to have a link to go somewhere else
3. Know when to use div | article | section. [Difference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element#content_sectioning)
4. use class as a methodology for self-documentation purposes, label every tag with a class and use **descriptive** names
5. Optimize your code for the "forever" part of it and "writing" part of it
6.
